We've made a content file in `content/_index.md`. Once you start adding content to it, you should see output generated in the `public/` folder.

If we open one of the `.html` files in Sublime, we should see some text and lots of angle brackets.

This looks messy, and it is, becuse this is generated by Hugo. These files are not meant to be read by humans.

You rarely have to write big files of HTML by hand, it's almost always generated, but it's worth being aware of it.

HTML is a structured format and requires starting and closing tags. Tags are specified in angle brackets, and closing tags have a forward slash after the opening angle bracket. Like this `<i>text</i>`.

Some quick examples are

- markdown `_` and `*` translate to `<i></i>` in HTML
- markdown `__` and `**` translate to `<b></b>` in HTML
- markdown backtick translates to \<code>\</code>

You will often encounter HTML when, e.g., trying to embed some content from another site. A popular example would be YouTube, you can embed a player into your page. When you select that option on the site, it gives you an HTML fragment to copy and paste.

The most important part to know about HTML in terms of content is that **markdown allows HTML in it**. You can mix the two.

This allows you to, e.g,. embedding YouTube players directly into your content.

So you could be writing content, and then suddenly

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

and then carry on writing content.

### Config note
This power can be used for great good, but also great evil. For sites that have other contributors, they might sneak in some malicious stuff, so putting HTML in your markdown is disabled by default.

If you want to embed things in your pages, you'll need to put these lines in your `config.toml` file.

```toml
[markup]
  [markup.goldmark]
    [markup.goldmark.renderer]
      unsafe = true
```

There are tons of other options for the Markdown renderer, they're all documented [on the Hugo site](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/).

# Let's make some content
We want to allow you the freedom to create whatever site you like, but let's assume all sites need an `About` page.

To create one, we can enter

```
hugo new about.md
```
